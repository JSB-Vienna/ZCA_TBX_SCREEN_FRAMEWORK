# toolbox_template
Pattern for new Toolbox Development Packages or others, including an adapted Bug report and feature request.

## Purpose / Objective
What is the purpose?

## Required packages
This package requires the [ZCA_TOOLBOX (Basic objects and exceptions)](https://github.com/JSB-Vienna/ZCA_TOOLBOX.git).
Currently, the APACK information is not as resolved as I expected. May I have misunderstood something, but the required packages should be imported automatically if ABABGit is used and APM classes are defined for the sub-packages. Have a [look here](https://docs.abapgit.org/user-guide/reference/apack.html) for more details.

### Smaller heading (up to 6 hashes possible)

Styling the text [look here in the GitHub Help](https://docs.github.com/de/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Cool, isn't it?
